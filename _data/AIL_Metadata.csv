ail_001,On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big? ðŸ¦œ,"Bender, M. Emily; Gebru, Timnit; McMillian-Major; Shmitchell, Shmargaret",2021-03-01,,"The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.",Critical of LLMs,https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922,Generative AI; Large-Language-Models,"RIbaric, Tim",eng,item,/objects/ail_001.png,screen capture of resource

How artificial intelligence might change academic library work: Applying the competencies literature and the theory of the professions. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 74(3), 367-380. https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24635","The probable impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on work, including professional work, is contested, but it is unlikely to leave them untouched. The purpose of this conceptual paper is to consider the likelihood of the adoption of different approaches to AI in academic libraries. As theoretical lenses to guide the analysis the paper draws on both the library and information science (LIS) literature on librarians' competencies and the notions of jurisdiction and hybrid logics drawn from the sociological theory of the professions. The paper starts by outlining these theories and then reviews the nature of AI and the range of its potential uses in academic libraries. The main focus of the paper is on the application of AI to knowledge discovery. Eleven different potential approaches libraries might adopt to such AI applications are analyzed and their likelihood evaluated. Then it is considered how a range of internal and external factors might influence the adoption of AI. In addition to reflecting on the possible impact of AI on librarianship the paper contributes to understanding how to synthesize the competencies literature with the theory of the profession and presents a new understanding of librarians as hybrid.",,https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.24635,acdemic librarianship,"RIbaric, Tim",eng,item,/objects/ail_017.png,screen capture of resource

The National Library of the Netherlands (KB) appreciates the  reat possibilities that AI offers to help us accomplish our mission to make our users smarter, more reative and more skilled. At the same time we do not close our eyes for unforeseen and unwanted side effects of AI, which may raise ethical questions, perhaps more than other forms of digital transformation. As National Library we feel we have a responsibility in addressing these issues. We have formulated seven principles we feel any AI-application in the context of the Library should comply with. Seven principles that takes the potential and the benefits of AI as starting point, and at the same imes give guidelines to avoid ethical pitfalls.",,https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3865343,,"RIbaric, Tim",eng,item,/objects/ail_018.png,screen capture of resource
