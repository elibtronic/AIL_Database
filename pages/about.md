## About AI.LD

![Splash Image](objects/splash.png)

The AI in Libraries Database (AILD) represents a colleciton of items that have been discussed or utlized with during the Library Juice Academic class [AI and Libraries, For Skeptics](https://libraryjuiceacademy.com/shop/course/331-ai-and-libraries-for-skeptics/).

This database is not intended to be comprehensive listing of all material concerned with AI and Libaries. It is a selection of material that highlights the reasons why we should all be skeptical about the advancement of AI, and in particular, within the Library.

## Inclusion Criteria

Students enrolled in the class will be given an opportunity to suggest additions, updates, or removals as part of a final project for the course. 

Some important things to keep in mind:

- Items should speak to themes developed in the class
- A focus on skepticism or critical understanding of AI is required
- Some relevant connection to libraries or librarians is a must
- All material should be availble freely without a pay wall
