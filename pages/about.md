![Splash Image](objects/splash.png)

The AI in Libraries Database (AILD) represents a colleciton of items that have been discussed or utlized with during the Library Juice Academic class [AI in Libraries, For Skeptics](https://libraryjuiceacademy.com/shop/course/331-ai-and-libraries-for-skeptics/).

This database is not intended to be comprehensive listing of all material concerned with AI and Libaries. It is a selection of material that highlights the reasons why we should all be skeptical about the advancement of AI, and in particular, within the Library.
